# udpEcho
Flood a destination link with different types of traffic.  Used as an endurance test for telecommunications rig.

<pre>
  A while back I worked on a telecommunications box which was essentially a modem aggregator.  The 
device included > 1300 endpoints in one box and backhauled to an AT&T T-carrier (1-3) and later the 
European equivalents.
  It started off with just UDP then added TCP when different hardware failure modes were identified.
The data from this utility would be compiled and displayed on an HTML front end.  This UI would be
used primarily by in-house manufacturing to sanity check any rig after assembly and before shipping.
